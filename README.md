# Heart_Failure_Detection


Heart disease is a significant global health issue, necessitating accurate prediction for improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. This project proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that employs various machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease based on a diverse range of patient attributes and medical data.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a comprehensive set of patient information, including demographic data, medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements.

## Key features

Utilizes machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes classifier.
Data preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, handling missing values, and categorical variable encoding.
Feature selection methods to enhance model interpretability and reduce complexity.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
#### 1. Clone the Repositoy
git clone https://github.com/meriemzogarh/Heart_Failure_Detection.git 
cd Heart_Failure_Detection
#### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data
The project uses a large dataset of labeled patient records for training the model.
The dataset includes diverse attributes, enabling the model to learn patterns and correlations.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
